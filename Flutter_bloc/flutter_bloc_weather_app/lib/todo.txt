       4. Authentication System with Firebase (Intermediate to Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Managing user authentication states with Bloc.
Integrating Firebase authentication.
Navigating between different screens based on authentication status.
Project Idea: Create a user authentication app that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication. Learn how to use Bloc to manage authentication states (e.g., authenticated, unauthenticated, etc.). This project will give you experience with both local state management and asynchronous events.
       5. E-commerce App (Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Managing multiple Blocs for different parts of the app.
Using Bloc for pagination, filtering, and sorting items.
Handling complex navigation and state sharing between different screens.
Project Idea: Build a simple e-commerce app where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders. You’ll need to manage states for product listing, cart management, and checkout. This project will help you understand how to organize multiple Blocs for different features within an app.
        6. Chat Application (Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Real-time state management with websockets or Firebase Firestore.
Handling events like sending/receiving messages, loading chat history, and managing active conversations.
Creating a layered Bloc structure for user state, message state, and chat rooms.
Project Idea: Build a real-time chat application where users can create accounts, join chat rooms, and send/receive messages in real-time. Learn how to handle real-time data streams and manage various events and states with Bloc.
        7. News App with Bloc and Infinite Scroll (Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Using Bloc with pagination.
Caching data using local storage (e.g., hive or sqflite).
Refreshing data and implementing pull-to-refresh functionality.
Project Idea: Create a news app that fetches articles from a public API (e.g., NewsAPI). The app should support infinite scrolling (loading more data as the user scrolls) and refresh the news feed when pulled down. Handling pagination and state transitions for loading more data will deepen your understanding of Bloc.
        8. Finance Tracker App (Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Managing multiple complex states.
Handling large-scale app architecture with multiple Blocs for different features.
Bloc for form validation and state persistence.
Project Idea: Build a personal finance tracker that allows users to add income, expenses, and track their budget. The app should include charts to visualize data (e.g., using fl_chart) and use Bloc to handle form validation, error states, and data persistence.
        9. Quiz App (Intermediate)
What you'll learn:
Managing state transitions for quiz progress, results, and user input.
Implementing navigation and data sharing between screens using Bloc.
Project Idea: Create a quiz app where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive a score at the end. Each question could be a new state, and you can use Bloc to manage quiz flow, display results, and reset the quiz.
        10. Expense Splitter App (Intermediate to Advanced)
What you'll learn:
Complex state management for calculations.
Handling multiple users and splitting expenses.
Bloc with a focus on form validation, error handling, and results display.
Project Idea: Build an app to help users split expenses among friends. Users can input expenses, and the app calculates who owes whom. This project will give you experience handling dynamic state transitions, complex calculations, and error handling with Bloc.
Skills You’ll Develop Across Projects:
State Management: Learn how to effectively manage and separate state using Bloc in various use cases.
Async Operations: Learn to handle API calls, Firebase integration, and real-time data using Bloc.
Testing: Write unit tests and widget tests for the Blocs you implement.
Error Handling: Properly handle errors and edge cases in your state management.
Navigation with Bloc: Manage navigation flows (e.g., login/logout, onboarding flow) with Bloc and how different states can trigger navigation events.
Additional Learning Tips:
Start Simple: Start with smaller apps like a counter or to-do app, then gradually move to more complex apps.
Documentation: Refer to the Flutter Bloc documentation to understand best practices and more advanced use cases.
Community & Tutorials: Explore open-source projects on GitHub, watch tutorials on YouTube, and read blog posts on Bloc architecture.
By building these projects, you will get a strong understanding of how to use Flutter Bloc effectively in different contexts, ranging from small apps to more complex systems. Let me know if you'd like help with any specific project setup!
